they lead to stress and other complications. One of the common method of relief is listening to Music. Rather than spending time on searching the right 
playlist for your mood, Facial expression recognition can be used to provide the user with the perfect playlists for all their moods. 'GroovFind' will act as one's 
go-to mood booster.
